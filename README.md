This is an app that populates gifs each time a button is clicked.   I chose the theme of TV shows so I decided to make my CSS follow suit.  If you click any of the buttons on the page, 9 gifs will show up on the TV screen above.  You can also add your own buttons for your favorite shows in the input field on the left hand side.  This new button will also populate gifs when pressed.

I used HTML 5, CSS 3, jQuery and API/AJAX for this assignment.
